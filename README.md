# LDS-UI-Redesign

Instructions provided by v0 in integrating the component for the **wireframe** on a Next.js project:

- To use this component in a Next.js project:

1. Ensure you have Next.js set up with the App Router.
2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
3. Replace placeholder images with actual images from your project.
4. Implement the actual functionality for search, filtering, and pagination.
5. Replace the placeholder data with real training program data from your backend or state management solution.

- The component uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling and incorporates **shadcn/ui** components like Button, Card, Checkbox, Input, Select, and Slider for a polished look. The layout is responsive and will adjust for different screen sizes. **The Next.js component includes**:

1. A header with the title, search bar, sort dropdown, and bookmark button.
2. A main content area divided into a sidebar with filters and a grid of training program cards.
3. The sidebar includes filters for Category/Topic, Institution, Target Participants, Duration, Mode of Learning, and Availability.
4. Each training program card displays a placeholder image, title, resource person, and details like start date, duration, location, and mode.
5. Pagination controls at the bottom of the main content.
6. A footer with the QC Government Human Resource information, social media links, and contact details.
